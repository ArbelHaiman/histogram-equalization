# histogram-equalization
GHE and LHE algorithms implementations

HE can be used for image enhancement and improving contrast in an image.

The program first applies global histogram equalization, which is a fast algorithm.
Then it applies local histogram equalization on the same image, which improves the 
contrast even more, but is very slow.
